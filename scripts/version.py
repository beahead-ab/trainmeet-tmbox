"""The version number, and everything that has to agree with it.

`VERSION` in the repo root is the single authoritative source. Every other
place a version appears - pyproject.toml, package.json, project.yml - is a
*derived* copy, written from here by `sync` and checked by the test suite.
Three of them had drifted apart before this existed, which is the whole
reason it does.

Nothing here talks to GitHub. It is a plain file editor, so the same commands
run identically in CI, on a laptop, and in a test.

  version.py current                 print the version
  version.py next minor              print what a minor bump would give
  version.py bump minor              write it, and sync the derived files
  version.py sync                    rewrite the derived files from VERSION
  version.py check                   exit 1 if any derived file disagrees
  version.py decide --range A..B     read commits and print major|minor|patch|skip
